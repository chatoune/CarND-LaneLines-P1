**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

I have implemented a six steps pipeline.
	1) Convert the image in gray
	2) Apply a Gaussian filter
	3) Apply the canny filter
	4) Use the example files to define the exclusion area for the Hough filter (mask)
	5) Apply the Hough filter and line drawing function
	6) Combine the result (detected lines layer) with the initial image


### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ...

### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline
